Download the code.<br>
Create a Discord Bot Application at https://discord.com/developers/applications/, make sure to enable ALL intents on this page.<br>
Copy the bot's token, open the main.py file with any text editor you like, scroll to the bottom and then you'll find "bot.run("TOKEN", reconnect=True)"<br>
Replace TOKEN with the token that you just copied.<br>
