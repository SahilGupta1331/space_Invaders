# Self hosting instructions

Download the code.

Create a Discord Bot Application at https://discord.com/developers/applications/, Make sure to enable ALL intents on this page.

Copy the bot's token, open the main.py file with any text editor you like, scroll to the bottom and then you'll find "bot.run("TOKEN", reconnect=True)"

Replace TOKEN with the token that you just copied.

Now download Python at https://www.python.org/downloads. Make sure to add it to path when installing.

Now that we've installed Python and added it to the path. Open Command Prompt and run "pip install discord.py".

After discord.py is installed, run "pip install tabulate" and finally .

Other than self host, you can also host it on any server if you want.

If something goes wrong make sure to contact me!
